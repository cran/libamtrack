Description: R interface to the open-source, ANSI C library 'libamtrack' (http://libamtrack.dkfz.org). 'libamtrack' provides computational routines for the prediction of detector response and radiobiological efficiency in heavy charged particle beams. It is designed for research in proton and ion dosimetry and radiotherapy. 'libamtrack' also includes many auxiliary physics routines for proton and ion beams. Original package and C-to-R conversion routines developed by Felix A. Klein.
